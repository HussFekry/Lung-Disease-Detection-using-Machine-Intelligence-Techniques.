# "Pneumonia Disease Detection using Machine Intelligence Techniques to Diagnose Acute Respiratory Failure"

## What is Pneumonia ?


Pneumonia is an inflammatory condition of the lung is affected primarily the small air sacs known as alveoli. Symptoms typically include some combination of productive or dry cough, chest pain, fever and difficulty breathing. The severity of the condition is variable. Pneumonia is usually caused by infection with viruses or bacteria. Pneumonia isn’t just one disease. It is a family of more than 200 different lung diseases. Statistics for Pneumonia disease detection in Egypt detected that Pneumonia deaths is about 13,393 with 2.50 % and Rate of 20.69 with a World Rank #100. According to the latest World Health Organization (WHO) data published in 2020 Lung Disease Deaths in Egypt reached 13,393 or 2.50% of total deaths.

## Our Solution/objective: 
Our main goal is earlier detection of Pneumonia by predicting a patient’s severity of decline in lung function and based on Chest X-ray of their lungs. Using image processing and machine intelligence techniques to help Pneumonia impacted patients and produce a prediction with the images of Pneumonia.

To sum up, the model’s presentation could be an extraordinary aid for exact assurance of the decay rate in the help of Pneumonia impacted patients. The proposed method further states that high resolution X-rays, evaluated by the proposed deep learning algorithm, provides a low-cost, fast, and accurate way to find the decline in the lung function of a patient suffering from Pneumonia disease.

## Future Work and Suggestions
In our future work, a convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm will be more developed, and we can apply our code on real world environment so it can be used on a larger scale as it's very effective compared to other deep learning algorithms. Also, the model’s presentation could be an extraordinary aid for exact assurance of the decay rate in for COVID-19 impacted patients.
